# Horiseon Code Refactor

## User Story
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
  - My task is completed when my website meets the following standards:

  - Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

  - HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

  - Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

  - Heading attributes fall in sequential order

  - Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title


## Usage

I've refactored the HTML and CSS to reflect these requirements. I've committed my changes and pushed to GitHub and deployed the link.
The site can be accessed on git pages at https://sridharaniruddha.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/
