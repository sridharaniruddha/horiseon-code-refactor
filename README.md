USER STORY
AS a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
My task is completed when my website meets the folowwing standards:

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

Heading attributes fall in sequential order

Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title



I've refactored the HTML and CSS to reflect these requirements. I've commited my changes and pushed to github and deployed git pages.

the site can be accessed on git pages at https://sridharaniruddha.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/


I've attached a screenshot of the site below.
