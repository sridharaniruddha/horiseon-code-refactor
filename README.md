USER STORY
AS a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
My task is completed when my website meets the folowwing standards:

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

Heading attributes fall in sequential order

Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title



I've refactored the HTML and CSS to reflect these requirements. I've commited my changes and pushed to github and deployed git pages.
